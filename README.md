# Open-Manus-Plan
## Generate Image With LLM

### Project Introduction

Although AIGC image-generation technology has advanced significantly, it still faces challenges. There's room for improvement in the quality and detail of generated images, especially with complex scenes and fine elements. Tools like ComfyUI are commonly used, but currently no universal workflow can solve all problems. This makes product commercialization difficult for enterprises and hard to meet users' diverse needs. Hence, our Open Manus Plan for image-generation was launched. While a universal workflow may emerge with AIGC's development, isn't this a good solution for now?

### Workflow Scheduling for Image Generation

#### Task Reception and Parsing

The system receives user input, parses the text via semantic understanding, and extracts key elements. This involves NLP techniques like tokenization and named entity recognition to grasp user needs.

#### Task Allocation and Resource Scheduling

Based on the parsed prompt, tasks are assigned to suitable workflows. Different workflows suit different image types or styles. The system also allocates computing resources like GPUs to ensure efficient image generation.

#### Model Inference and Image Generation

Image generation models use deep learning algorithms to create images based on semantic understanding. They learn from training data to produce high-quality images that meet user requirements.

#### Result Processing and Feedback

The generated images are post-processed and returned to the user. The system may collect user feedback to optimize the model. If unsatisfied, users can provide feedback for the system to adjust parameters and generate better images.
